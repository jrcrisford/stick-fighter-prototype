# Stick Fighter – Game Prototype  
**KIT207 – Game Design and Production**  
**Team: The Lobotomy**

Stick Fighter is a fast-paced 3D hack-and-slash arena brawler where players fight using improvised stick weapons. Developed in Unity and inspired by childhood imagination, the game features chaotic melee combat, a light-hearted tone, and physics-based interactions. This playable prototype was created as part of Assignment 5 for KIT207 at the University of Tasmania.

- **Engine**: Unity  
- **Platform**: WebGL (itch.io), Desktop (Windows build optional)

## 🧠 Concept & Theme

Stick Fighter was inspired by the 2025 theme **“Twin Stick”**, interpreted both mechanically and symbolically:
